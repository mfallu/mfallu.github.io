Manual curation is used to establish whether the literature and the records are indeed consistent. We explore in this paper an automated method for assessing the consistency of biological assertions, to assist biocurators, which we call BARC, Biocuration tool for Assessment of Relation Consistency. In this method a biological assertion is represented as a relation between two objects (for example, a gene and a disease); we then use our novel set-based relevance algorithm SaBRA to retrieve pertinent literature, and apply a classifier to estimate the likelihood that this relation (assertion) is correct.\n\nResults\nOur experiments on assessing gene–disease relations and protein–protein interactions using the PubMed Central collection show that BARC can be effective at assisting curators to perform data cleansing. Specifically, the results obtained showed that BARC substantially outperforms the best baselines, with an improvement of F-measure of 3.5% and 13%, respectively, on gene-disease relations and protein-protein interactions. We have additionally carried out a feature analysis that showed that all feature types are informative, as are all fields of the documents.\n\nConclusions\nBARC provides a clear benefit for the biocuration community, as there are no prior automated tools for identifying inconsistent assertions in large-scale biological databases."},{"id":1373006,"title":"From POS tagging to dependency parsing for biomedical event extraction","abstract":"Given the importance of relation or event extraction from biomedical research publications to support knowledge capture and synthesis, and the strong dependency of approaches to this information extraction task on syntactic information, it is valuable to understand which approaches to syntactic processing of biomedical text have the highest performance."},{"id":1392805,"title":"End-to-end neural relation extraction using deep biaffine attention","abstract":"© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

They significantly increase database search time and can lead to uninformative search results containing similar sequences. Sequence clustering methods have been used to address this issue to group similar sequences into clusters. These clusters form a nonredundant database consisting of representatives (one record per cluster) and members (the remaining records in a cluster). In this approach, for nonredundant database search, users search against representatives first and optionally expand search results by exploring member records from matching clusters. Existing studies used Precision and Recall to assess the search effectiveness of nonredundant databases. However, the use of Precision and Recall does not model user behavior in practice and thus may not reflect practical search effectiveness. In this study, we first propose innovative evaluation metrics to measure search effectiveness. The findings are that (1) the Precision of expanded sets is consistently lower than that of representatives, with a decrease up to 7% at top ranks; and (2) Recall is uninformative because, for most queries, expanded sets return more records than does search of the original unclustered databases. Motivated by these findings, we propose a solution that returns a user-specified proportion of top similar records, modeled by a ranking function that aggregates sequence and annotation similarities. In experiments undertaken on UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, the largest expert-curated protein database, we show that our method dramatically reduces the number of returned sequences, increases Precision by 3%, and does not impact effective search time."},{"id":1364002,"title":"BioCreative VI Precision Medicine Track system performance is constrained by entity recognition and variations in corpus characteristics"},{"id":1355309,"title":"Convolutional neural networks for chemical-disease relation extraction are improved with character-based word embeddings","abstract":"We investigate the incorporation of character-based word representations into a standard CNN-based relation extraction model.

The presence of duplicates, implying either redundancy or inconsistency, can have a range of impacts on the quality of analyses that use the data. To provide a sound basis for research on this issue in databases of nucleotide sequences, we have developed new, large-scale validated collections of duplicates, which can be used to test the effectiveness of duplicate detection methods. Previous collections were either designed primarily to test efficiency, or contained only a limited number of duplicates of limited kinds. To date, duplicate detection methods have been evaluated on separate, inconsistent benchmarks, leading to results that cannot be compared and, due to limitations of the benchmarks, of questionable generality. In this study, we present three nucleotide sequence database benchmarks, based on information drawn from a range of resources, including information derived from mapping to two data sections within the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB), UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and UniProtKB/TrEMBL. Each benchmark has distinct characteristics. We quantify these characteristics and argue for their complementary value in evaluation. The benchmarks collectively contain a vast number of validated biological duplicates; the largest has nearly half a billion duplicate pairs (although this is probably only a tiny fraction of the total that is present). They are also the first benchmarks targeting the primary nucleotide databases. The records include the 21 most heavily studied organisms in molecular biology research. Our quantitative analysis shows that duplicates in the different benchmarks, and in different organisms, have different characteristics. It is thus unreliable to evaluate duplicate detection methods against any single benchmark. For example, the benchmark derived from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot mappings identifies more diverse types of duplicates, showing the importance of expert curation, but is limited to coding sequences. Overall, these benchmarks form a resource that we believe will be of great value for development and evaluation of the duplicate detection or record linkage methods that are required to help maintain these essential resources.

approaches for haplotype block phasing.","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Knowledge of phase, the specific allele sequence on each copy of homologous chromosomes, is increasingly recognized as critical for detecting certain classes of disease-associated mutations. One approach for detecting such mutations is through phased haplotype association analysis. While the accuracy of methods for phasing genotype data has been widely explored, there has been little attention given to phasing accuracy at haplotype block scale. Understanding the combined impact of the accuracy of phasing tool and the method used to determine haplotype blocks on the error rate within the determined blocks is essential to conduct accurate haplotype analyses. RESULTS: We present a systematic study exploring the relationship between seven widely used phasing methods and two common methods for determining haplotype blocks. The evaluation focuses on the number of haplotype blocks that are incorrectly phased. Insights from these results are used to develop a haplotype estimator based on a consensus of three tools. The consensus estimator achieved the most accurate phasing in all applied tests. Individually, EAGLE2, BEAGLE and SHAPEIT2 alternate in being the best performing tool in different scenarios. Determining haplotype blocks based on linkage disequilibrium leads to more correctly phased blocks compared to a sliding window approach. We find that there is little difference between phasing sections of a genome (e.g. a gene) compared to phasing entire chromosomes. Finally, we show that the location of phasing error varies when the tools are applied to the same data several times, a finding that could be important for downstream analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The choice of phasing and block determination algorithms and their interaction impacts the accuracy of phased haplotype blocks. This work provides guidance and evidence for the different design choices needed for analyses using haplotype blocks. The study highlights a number of issues that may have limited the replicability of previous haplotype analysis.","year":2019,"authors":[{"position":1,"first_name":"Ziad","last_name":"Al Bkhetan"},{"position":2,"first_name":"Justin","last_name":"Zobel"},{"position":3,"first_name":"Adam","last_name":"Kowalczyk"},{"position":4,"first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor"},{"position":5,"first_name":"Benjamin","last_name":"Goudey"}],"uom_authors":[{"person_id":90739,"preferred_name":"Adam Kowalczyk","first_name":"Adam","last_name":"Kowalczyk","org_id":4257,"org_name":"Computing and Information Systems"},{"person_id":458973,"preferred_name":"Karin Verspoor","first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor","org_id":4257,"org_name":"Computing and Information Systems"},{"person_id":87273,"preferred_name":"Justin Zobel","first_name":"Justin","last_name":"Zobel","org_id":5824,"org_name":"Research"}],"is_public":true,"doi":"10.1186/s12859-019-3095-8","issue":"1","volume":"20","pagination":{"begin":"540"},"keywords":["haplotype analysis","haplotype blocks","phasing","haplotype estimation"],"editors":[],"citations":[{"count":0,"source":"epmc"},{"count":0,"source":"scopus"}],"grants":[],"subject_areas":[{"anzsrc_name":"FOR 2008 6 Digit Code","code":"010202","name_array":["Biological Mathematics ","Applied Mathematics","Mathematical Sciences"],"name_02":"Mathematical Sciences","name_04":"Applied Mathematics","name_06":"Biological Mathematics "},{"anzsrc_name":"FOR 2008 6 Digit Code","code":"060102","name_array":["Bioinformatics","Biochemistry and Cell Biology","Biological Sciences"],"name_02":"Biological Sciences","name_04":"Biochemistry and Cell Biology","name_06":"Bioinformatics"},{"anzsrc_name":"FOR 2008 6 Digit Code","code":"080702","name_array":["Health Informatics","Library and Information Studies","Information and Computing Sciences"],"name_02":"Information and Computing Sciences","name_04":"Library and Information Studies","name_06":"Health Informatics"},{"anzsrc_name":"SEO 2008 6 Digit Code","code":"970108","name_array":["Expanding Knowledge in the Information and Computing Sciences","Expanding Knowledge","Expanding Knowledge","Expanding knowledge"],"name_02":"Expanding Knowledge","name_04":"Expanding Knowledge","name_06":"Expanding Knowledge in the Information and Computing Sciences"},{"anzsrc_name":"SEO 2008 6 Digit Code","code":"970111","name_array":["Expanding Knowledge in the Medical and Health Sciences","Expanding Knowledge","Expanding Knowledge","Expanding knowledge"],"name_02":"Expanding Knowledge","name_04":"Expanding Knowledge","name_06":"Expanding Knowledge in the Medical and Health Sciences"}]},{"id":"1392030","visibility":true,"last_updated":"2019-07-04T05:03:14.880000+00:00","publication_type":"Journal article","publisher_name":"BMC","journal_name":"BMC Bioinformatics","title":"Automated assessment of biological database assertions using the scientific literature","abstract":"Background\nThe large biological databases such as GenBank contain vast numbers of records, the content of which is substantively based on external resources, including published literature. Manual curation is used to establish whether the literature and the records are indeed consistent. We explore in this paper an automated method for assessing the consistency of biological assertions, to assist biocurators, which we call BARC, Biocuration tool for Assessment of Relation Consistency. In this method a biological assertion is represented as a relation between two objects (for example, a gene and a disease); we then use our novel set-based relevance algorithm SaBRA to retrieve pertinent literature, and apply a classifier to estimate the likelihood that this relation (assertion) is correct.\n\nResults\nOur experiments on assessing gene–disease relations and protein–protein interactions using the PubMed Central collection show that BARC can be effective at assisting curators to perform data cleansing. Specifically, the results obtained showed that BARC substantially outperforms the best baselines, with an improvement of F-measure of 3.5% and 13%, respectively, on gene-disease relations and protein-protein interactions. We have additionally carried out a feature analysis that showed that all feature types are informative, as are all fields of the documents.\n\nConclusions\nBARC provides a clear benefit for the biocuration community, as there are no prior automated tools for identifying inconsistent assertions in large-scale biological databases.","year":2019,"authors":[{"position":1,"first_name":"Mohamed Reda","last_name":"Bouadjenek"},{"position":2,"first_name":"Justin","last_name":"Zobel"},{"position":3,"first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor"}],"uom_authors":[{"person_id":764406,"preferred_name":"Mohamed Reda Bouadjenek","first_name":"Mohamed Reda","last_name":"Bouadjenek","org_id":4257,"org_name":"Computing and Information Systems"},{"person_id":87273,"preferred_name":"Justin Zobel","first_name":"Justin","last_name":"Zobel","org_id":5824,"org_name":"Research"},{"person_id":458973,"preferred_name":"Karin Verspoor","first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor","org_id":4257,"org_name":"Computing and Information Systems"}],"is_public":true,"doi":"10.1186/s12859-019-2801-x","issue":"1","volume":"20","number":"UNSP 216","pagination":{"end":"22","begin":"1"},"keywords":["science & technology","databases, nucleic acid","algorithms","data mining","data cleansing","publishing","data quality","names","data analysis","life sciences & biomedicine","biotechnology & applied microbiology","biochemical research methods","biochemistry & molecular biology","biological databases","challenges","protein interaction maps","humans","databases, factual","mathematical & computational biology","protein"],"editors":[],"citations":[{"count":0,"source":"epmc"},{"count":0,"source":"scopus"}],"grants":[{"number":"DP150101550","awardedBy":"Australian Research Council"}],"funding_acknowledgements":"The project receives funding from the Australian Research Council through a Discovery Project grant, DP150101550.

The biomedical literature provides a rich foundation for populating these KBs, reporting genetic and molecular interactions that provide the scaffold for the cellular regulatory systems and detailing the influence of genetic variants in these interactions. The goal of BioCreative VI Precision Medicine Track was to extract this particular type of information and was organized in two tasks: (i) document triage task, focused on identifying scientific literature containing experimentally verified protein–protein interactions (PPIs) affected by genetic mutations and (ii) relation extraction task, focused on extracting the affected interactions (protein pairs). To assist system developers and task participants, a large-scale corpus of PubMed documents was manually annotated for this task. Ten teams worldwide contributed 22 distinct text-mining models for the document triage task, and six teams worldwide contributed 14 different text-mining systems for the relation extraction task. When comparing the text-mining system predictions with human annotations, for the triage task, the best F-score was 69.06%, the best precision was 62.89%, the best recall was 98.0% and the best average precision was 72.5%. For the relation extraction task, when taking homologous genes into account, the best F-score was 37.73%, the best precision was 46.5% and the best recall was 54.1%. Submitted systems explored a wide range of methods, from traditional rule-based, statistical and machine learning systems to state-of-the-art deep learning methods. Given the level of participation and the individual team results we find the precision medicine track to be successful in engaging the text-mining research community. In the meantime, the track produced a manually annotated corpus of 5509 PubMed documents developed by BioGRID curators and relevant for precision medicine. The data set is freely available to the community, and the specific interactions have been integrated into the BioGRID data set. In addition, this challenge provided the first results of automatically identifying PubMed articles that describe PPI affected by mutations, as well as extracting the affected relations from those articles. Still, much progress is needed for computer-assisted precision medicine text mining to become mainstream. Future work should focus on addressing the remaining technical challenges and incorporating the practical benefits of text-mining tools into real-world precision medicine information-related curation.","year":2019,"authors":[{"position":1,"first_name":"Rezarta Islamaj","last_name":"Dogan"},{"position":2,"first_name":"Sun","last_name":"Kim"},{"position":3,"first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Chatr-aryamontri"},{"position":4,"first_name":"Chih-Hsuan","last_name":"Wei"},{"position":5,"first_name":"Donald C","last_name":"Comeau"},{"position":6,"first_name":"Rui","last_name":"Antunes"},{"position":7,"first_name":"Sergio","last_name":"Matos"},{"position":8,"first_name":"Qingyu","last_name":"Chen"},{"position":9,"first_name":"Aparna","last_name":"Elangovan"},{"position":10,"first_name":"Nagesh C","last_name":"Panyam"},{"position":11,"first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor"},{"position":12,"first_name":"Hongfang","last_name":"Liu"},{"position":13,"first_name":"Yanshan","last_name":"Wang"},{"position":14,"first_name":"Zhuang","last_name":"Liu"},{"position":15,"first_name":"Berna","last_name":"Altinel"},{"position":16,"first_name":"Zehra Melce","last_name":"Husunbeyi"},{"position":17,"first_name":"Arzucan","last_name":"Ozgur"},{"position":18,"first_name":"Aris","last_name":"Fergadis"},{"position":19,"first_name":"Chen-Kai","last_name":"Wang"},{"position":20,"first_name":"Hong-Jie","last_name":"Dai"},{"position":21,"first_name":"Tung","last_name":"Tran"},{"position":22,"first_name":"Ramakanth","last_name":"Kavuluru"},{"position":23,"first_name":"Ling","last_name":"Luo"},{"position":24,"first_name":"Albert","last_name":"Steppi"},{"position":25,"first_name":"Jinfeng","last_name":"Zhang"},{"position":26,"first_name":"Jinchan","last_name":"Qu"},{"position":27,"first_name":"Zhiyong","last_name":"Lu"}],"uom_authors":[{"person_id":458973,"preferred_name":"Karin Verspoor","first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor","org_id":4257,"org_name":"Computing and Information Systems"},{"person_id":686758,"preferred_name":"Qingyu Chen","first_name":"Qingyu","last_name":"Chen"}],"is_public":true,"resource_link":"http://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/bitstream/11343/227579/1/Overview+of+the+BioCreative+VI+Precision+Medicine+Track+mining+protein+interactions+and+mutations+for+precision+medicine.pdf","doi":"10.1093/database/bay147","number":"ARTN bay147","keywords":["science & technology","text","computational biology","precision medicine","information","mutation","protein interaction mapping","protein interaction maps","tmvar","data mining","humans","software","extraction","databases, protein","mathematical & computational biology","life sciences & biomedicine"],"editors":[],"citations":[{"count":0,"source":"epmc"},{"count":0,"source":"scopus"}],"grants":[{"awardedBy":"National Institutes of Health Intramural Research Program National Library of Medicine"},{"number":"R01OD010929","awardedBy":"National Institutes of Health Office of Research Infrastructure Programs"},{"number":"R24OD011194","awardedBy":"National Institutes of Health Office of Research Infrastructure Programs"}],"funding_acknowledgements":"National Institutes of Health Intramural Research Program National Library of Medicine; National Institutes of Health Office of Research Infrastructure Programs (R01OD010929 and R24OD011194 to A.C.-a.).","subject_areas":[{"anzsrc_name":"FOR 2008 6 Digit Code","code":"060102","name_array":["Bioinformatics","Biochemistry and Cell Biology","Biological Sciences"],"name_02":"Biological Sciences","name_04":"Biochemistry and Cell Biology","name_06":"Bioinformatics"},{"anzsrc_name":"FOR 2008 6 Digit Code","code":"080702","name_array":["Health Informatics","Library and Information Studies","Information and Computing Sciences"],"name_02":"Information and Computing Sciences","name_04":"Library and Information Studies","name_06":"Health Informatics"},{"anzsrc_name":"SEO 2008 6 Digit Code","code":"890205","name_array":["Information Processing Services (incl.

One unique aspect of VetCompass Australia is its focus on applying natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to analyse the records, similar to efforts conducted in other medical studies. RESULTS: The free text fields of 4,394,493 veterinary consultation records of dogs and cats between 2013 and 2018 were collated by VetCompass Australia and NLP techniques applied to enable the querying of the antimicrobial usage within these consultations.

A specific challenge is duplication, that is, the presence of redundancy (records with high similarity) or inconsistency (dissimilar records that correspond to the same entity). The characteristics (which records are duplicates), impact (why duplicates are significant), and solutions (how to address duplication), are not well understood. Studies on the topic are neither recent nor comprehensive. In addition, other data quality issues, such as inconsistencies and inaccuracies, are also of concern in the context of biological databases. A primary focus of this paper is to present and consolidate the opinions of over 20 experts and practitioners on the topic of duplication in biological sequence databases. The results reveal that survey participants believe that duplicate records are diverse; that the negative impacts of duplicates are severe, while positive impacts depend on correct identification of duplicates; and that duplicate detection methods need to be more precise, scalable, and robust. A secondary focus is to consider other quality issues. We observe that biocuration is the key mechanism used to ensure the quality of this data, and explore the issues through a case study of curation in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot as well as an interview with an experienced biocurator. While biocuration is a vital solution for handling of data quality issues, a broader community effort is needed to provide adequate support for thorough biocuration in the face of widespread quality concerns.","year":2019,"authors":[{"position":1,"first_name":"Qingyu","last_name":"Chen"},{"position":2,"first_name":"Ramona","last_name":"Britto"},{"position":3,"first_name":"Ivan","last_name":"Erill"},{"position":4,"first_name":"Constance","last_name":"J.

Parallel corpora can be leveraged to implement cross-lingual information retrieval or machine translation tools. Herein, we review the extent of parallel corpus coverage in the biomedical domain. Specifically, we perform a scoping review of existing resources and we describe the recent development of new datasets for scientific literature (the EDP dataset and an extension of the Scielo corpus) and clinical trials (the ReBEC corpus). These corpora are currently being used in the biomedical task in the Conference on Machine Translation (WMT'16 and WMT'17), which illustrates their potential for improving and evaluating biomedical machine translation systems. Furthermore, we suggest additional applications for multilingual natural language processing using these resources, and plan to extend resource coverage to additional text genres and language pairs.","year":2019,"authors":[{"position":1,"first_name":"A","last_name":"Névéol"},{"position":2,"first_name":"AJ","last_name":"Yepes"},{"position":3,"first_name":"M","last_name":"Neves"},{"position":4,"first_name":"K","last_name":"Verspoor"}],"uom_authors":[{"person_id":458973,"preferred_name":"Karin Verspoor","first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor","org_id":4257,"org_name":"Computing and Information Systems"}],"is_public":true,"pagination":{"end":"291","begin":"286"},"keywords":["parallel corpus","biomedical domain","multilingual applications"],"editors":[],"citations":[{"count":0,"source":"scopus"}],"grants":[],"subject_areas":[{"anzsrc_name":"FOR 2008 6 Digit Code","code":"080107","name_array":["Natural Language Processing","Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing","Information and Computing Sciences"],"name_02":"Information and Computing Sciences","name_04":"Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing","name_06":"Natural Language Processing"},{"anzsrc_name":"FOR 2008 6 Digit Code","code":"080110","name_array":["Simulation and Modelling ","Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing","Information and Computing Sciences"],"name_02":"Information and Computing Sciences","name_04":"Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing","name_06":"Simulation and Modelling "},{"anzsrc_name":"FOR 2008 6 Digit Code","code":"080604","name_array":["Database Management","Information Systems","Information and Computing Sciences"],"name_02":"Information and Computing Sciences","name_04":"Information Systems","name_06":"Database Management"},{"anzsrc_name":"SEO 2008 6 Digit Code","code":"890205","name_array":["Information Processing Services (incl.

Surveillance of HAIs is essential for effective infection-prevention programmes. However, little is known regarding standardized or specific surveillance methods currently employed for high-risk hospitalized patients. METHODS: A systematic review adopting a narrative synthesis approach of published material between 1 January 2000 and 31 March 2018 was conducted. Publications describing the application of traditional and/or electronic surveillance of HAIs in immunocompromised patient settings were identified from the Ovid MEDLINE®, Ovid Embase® and Elsevier Scopus® search engines [PROSPERO international prospective register of systematic reviews (registration ID: CRD42018093651)]. RESULTS: In total, 2708 studies were screened, of whom 17 fulfilled inclusion criteria. Inpatients diagnosed with haematological malignancies were the most-represented immunosuppressed population. The majority of studies described manual HAI surveillance utilizing internationally accepted definitions for infection. Chart review of diagnostic and pathology reports was most commonly employed for case ascertainment. Data linkage of disparate datasets was performed in two studies. The most frequently monitored infections were bloodstream infections and invasive fungal disease. No surveillance programmes applied risk adjustment for reporting surveillance outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Targeted, tailored monitoring of HAIs in high-risk immunocompromised settings is infrequently reported in current hospital surveillance programmes. Standardized surveillance frameworks, including risk adjustment and timely data dissemination, are required to adequately support infection-prevention programmes in these populations.","year":2019,"authors":[{"position":1,"first_name":"Jake C","last_name":"Valentine"},{"position":2,"first_name":"Lisa","last_name":"Hall"},{"position":3,"first_name":"Karin M","last_name":"Verspoor"},{"position":4,"first_name":"Leon J","last_name":"Worth"}],"uom_authors":[{"person_id":458973,"preferred_name":"Karin Verspoor","first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor","org_id":4257,"org_name":"Computing and Information Systems"},{"person_id":16701,"preferred_name":"Leon Worth","first_name":"Leon","last_name":"Worth","org_id":5699,"org_name":"Medical Education"}],"is_public":true,"doi":"10.1093/ije/dyz162","keywords":["case ascertainment","immunocompromised","surveillance","case definitions","healthcare-associated infections"],"editors":[],"citations":[{"count":0,"source":"epmc"}],"grants":[],"subject_areas":[{"anzsrc_name":"FOR 2008 6 Digit Code","code":"110801","name_array":["Medical Bacteriology ","Medical Microbiology","Medical and Health Sciences"],"name_02":"Medical and Health Sciences","name_04":"Medical Microbiology","name_06":"Medical Bacteriology "},{"anzsrc_name":"FOR 2008 6 Digit Code","code":"111706","name_array":["Epidemiology ","Public Health and Health Services","Medical and Health Sciences"],"name_02":"Medical and Health Sciences","name_04":"Public Health and Health Services","name_06":"Epidemiology "},{"anzsrc_name":"SEO 2008 6 Digit Code","code":"920109","name_array":["Infectious Diseases","Clinical Health (Organs, Diseases and Abnormal Conditions)","Health","Society"],"name_02":"Health","name_04":"Clinical Health (Organs, Diseases and Abnormal Conditions)","name_06":"Infectious Diseases"}]},{"id":"1410503","visibility":true,"last_updated":"2019-10-29T22:57:20.330000+00:00","publication_type":"Journal article","journal_name":"Studies in Health Technology and Informatics","title":"Characterizing the Scope of Exposome Research Through Topic Modeling and Ontology Analysis.","abstract":"Exposomics is a field of research which is receiving growing attention.

Finding all relevant published evidence for a particular medical case is a time and labour intensive task, given the breadth of the biomedical literature. Automatic quantification of conceptual relationships between key clinical evidence within and across publications, despite variations in the expression of clinically-relevant concepts, can help to facilitate synthesis of evidence. In this study, we aim to provide an approach towards expediting evidence synthesis by quantifying semantic similarity of key evidence as expressed in the form of individual sentences. Such semantic textual similarity can be applied as a key approach for supporting selection of related studies. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We propose a generalisable approach for quantifying semantic similarity of clinical evidence in the biomedical literature, specifically considering the similarity of sentences corresponding to a given type of evidence, such as clinical interventions, population information, clinical findings, etc. We develop three sets of generic, ontology-based, and vector-space models of similarity measures that make use of a variety of lexical, conceptual, and contextual information to quantify the similarity of full sentences containing clinical evidence. To understand the impact of different similarity measures on the overall evidence semantic similarity quantification, we provide a comparative analysis of these measures when used as input to an unsupervised linear interpolation and a supervised regression ensemble. In order to provide a reliable test-bed for this experiment, we generate a dataset of 1,000 pairs of sentences from biomedical publications that are annotated by ten human experts. We also extend the experiments on an external dataset for further generalisability testing. RESULTS: The combination of all diverse similarity measures showed stronger correlations with the gold standard similarity scores in the dataset than any individual kind of measure. Our approach reached near 0.80 average Pearson correlation across different clinical evidence types using the devised similarity measures. Although they were more effective when combined together, individual generic and vector-space measures also resulted in strong similarity quantification when used in both unsupervised and supervised models. On the external dataset, our similarity measures were highly competitive with the state-of-the-art approaches developed and trained specifically on that dataset for predicting semantic similarity. CONCLUSION: Experimental results showed that the proposed semantic similarity quantification approach can effectively identify related clinical evidence that is reported in the literature. The comparison with a state-of-the-art method demonstrated the effectiveness of the approach, and experiments with an external dataset support its generalisability.","year":2019,"authors":[{"position":1,"first_name":"Hamed","last_name":"Hassanzadeh"},{"position":2,"first_name":"Anthony","last_name":"Nguyen"},{"position":3,"first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor"}],"uom_authors":[{"person_id":458973,"preferred_name":"Karin Verspoor","first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor","org_id":4257,"org_name":"Computing and Information Systems"}],"is_public":true,"doi":"10.1016/j.jbi.2019.103321","pagination":{"begin":"103321"},"keywords":["clinical semantic similarity","systematic review","evidence based medicine","clinical evidence"],"editors":[],"citations":[{"count":0,"source":"epmc"}],"grants":[]},{"id":"1353927","visibility":true,"last_updated":"2019-06-21T19:25:43.667000+00:00","publication_type":"Journal article","publisher_name":"JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC","journal_name":"Journal of Medical Internet Research","title":"The Use of Web-Based Technologies in Health Research Participation: Qualitative Study of Consumer and Researcher Experiences","year":2018,"authors":[{"position":1,"first_name":"Patrick Cheong-Iao","last_name":"Pang"},{"position":2,"first_name":"Shanton","last_name":"Chang"},{"position":3,"first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor"},{"position":4,"first_name":"Ornella","last_name":"Clavisi"}],"uom_authors":[{"person_id":611522,"preferred_name":"Patrick Pang","first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"Pang","org_id":4257,"org_name":"Computing and Information Systems"},{"person_id":3747,"preferred_name":"Shanton Chang","first_name":"Shanton","last_name":"Chang","org_id":4257,"org_name":"Computing and Information Systems"},{"person_id":458973,"preferred_name":"Karin Verspoor","first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor","org_id":4257,"org_name":"Computing and Information Systems"}],"is_public":true,"doi":"10.2196/12094","issue":"10","volume":"20","number":"PMID 30377139","pagination":{"begin":"e12094"},"keywords":["community","interventions","patient","involvement","challenges","recruitment","consumer behavior","pain","medical informatics","patient portals","information-seeking behaviors","health care sciences & services","registries","research design","social media","science & technology","social networking","life sciences & biomedicine","research subjects"],"editors":[],"citations":[{"count":0,"source":"epmc"},{"count":0,"source":"scopus"}],"grants":[{"awardedBy":"Musculoskeletal Australia"}],"funding_acknowledgements":"The authors acknowledge the support from Musculoskeletal Australia for this study.

We present the design of DrKnow, a web-based learning application that utilises a clinical decision support system (CDSS) and virtual cases to support the development of problem-solving and decision-making skills in medical students. Based on the clinical information they request and prioritise, DrKnow provides personalised feedback to help students develop differential and provisional diagnoses at key decision points as they work through the virtual cases. Once students make a final diagnosis, DrKnow presents students with information about their overall diagnostic performance as well as recommendations for diagnosing similar cases. This paper argues that designing DrKnow around a task-sensitive CDSS provides a suitable approach enabling positive student learning outcomes, while simultaneously overcoming the resource challenges of expert clinician-supported bedside teaching.","year":2018,"authors":[{"position":1,"first_name":"Piyapong","last_name":"Khumrin"},{"position":2,"first_name":"Anna","last_name":"Ryan"},{"position":3,"first_name":"Terry","last_name":"Juddy"},{"position":4,"first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor"}],"uom_authors":[{"person_id":249939,"preferred_name":"Anna Ryan","first_name":"Anna","last_name":"Ryan","org_id":5699,"org_name":"Medical Education"},{"person_id":458973,"preferred_name":"Karin Verspoor","first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor","org_id":4257,"org_name":"Computing and Information Systems"},{"person_id":2927,"preferred_name":"Terry Judd","first_name":"Terry","last_name":"Judd","org_id":5699,"org_name":"Medical Education"}],"is_public":true,"volume":"2018","pagination":{"end":"1357","begin":"1348"},"keywords":[],"editors":[],"citations":[{"count":0,"source":"epmc"},{"count":0,"source":"scopus"}],"grants":[]},{"id":"1290624","visibility":true,"last_updated":"2019-10-25T18:27:48.573000+00:00","publication_type":"Journal article","journal_name":"Foundations and Trends® in Information Retrieval","title":"Web forum retrieval and text analytics: A survey","year":2018,"authors":[{"position":1,"first_name":"D","last_name":"Hoogeveen"},{"position":2,"first_name":"L","last_name":"Wang"},{"position":3,"first_name":"T","last_name":"Baldwin"},{"position":4,"first_name":"KM","last_name":"Verspoor"}],"uom_authors":[{"person_id":28799,"preferred_name":"Tim Baldwin","first_name":"Tim","last_name":"Baldwin","org_id":4257,"org_name":"Computing and Information Systems"},{"person_id":458973,"preferred_name":"Karin Verspoor","first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor","org_id":4257,"org_name":"Computing and Information Systems"}],"is_public":true,"doi":"10.1561/1500000062","issue":"1","volume":"12","pagination":{"end":"167","begin":"1"},"keywords":[],"editors":[],"citations":[{"count":9,"source":"scopus"}],"grants":[],"subject_areas":[{"anzsrc_name":"FOR 2008 6 Digit Code","code":"091599","name_array":["Interdisciplinary Engineering not elsewhere classified ","Interdisciplinary Engineering","Engineering"],"name_02":"Engineering","name_04":"Interdisciplinary Engineering","name_06":"Interdisciplinary Engineering not elsewhere classified "},{"anzsrc_name":"SEO 2008 6 Digit Code","code":"890205","name_array":["Information Processing Services (incl.

They significantly increase database search time and can lead to uninformative search results containing similar sequences. Sequence clustering methods have been used to address this issue to group similar sequences into clusters. These clusters form a nonredundant database consisting of representatives (one record per cluster) and members (the remaining records in a cluster). In this approach, for nonredundant database search, users search against representatives first and optionally expand search results by exploring member records from matching clusters. Existing studies used Precision and Recall to assess the search effectiveness of nonredundant databases. However, the use of Precision and Recall does not model user behavior in practice and thus may not reflect practical search effectiveness. In this study, we first propose innovative evaluation metrics to measure search effectiveness. The findings are that (1) the Precision of expanded sets is consistently lower than that of representatives, with a decrease up to 7% at top ranks; and (2) Recall is uninformative because, for most queries, expanded sets return more records than does search of the original unclustered databases. Motivated by these findings, we propose a solution that returns a user-specified proportion of top similar records, modeled by a ranking function that aggregates sequence and annotation similarities. In experiments undertaken on UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, the largest expert-curated protein database, we show that our method dramatically reduces the number of returned sequences, increases Precision by 3%, and does not impact effective search time.","year":2018,"authors":[{"position":1,"first_name":"Qingyu","last_name":"Chen"},{"position":2,"first_name":"Xiuzhen","last_name":"Zhang"},{"position":3,"first_name":"Yu","last_name":"Wan"},{"position":4,"first_name":"Justin","last_name":"Zobel"},{"position":5,"first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor"}],"uom_authors":[{"person_id":87273,"preferred_name":"Justin Zobel","first_name":"Justin","last_name":"Zobel","org_id":5824,"org_name":"Research"},{"person_id":458973,"preferred_name":"Karin Verspoor","first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor","org_id":4257,"org_name":"Computing and Information Systems"},{"person_id":686758,"preferred_name":"Qingyu Chen","first_name":"Qingyu","last_name":"Chen"}],"is_public":true,"doi":"10.1089/cmb.2018.0198","issue":"6","volume":"26","pagination":{"end":"617","begin":"605"},"keywords":["sequence clustering","information retrieval","physical sciences","machine learning","database search","biotechnology & applied microbiology","biological databases","mathematical & computational biology","life sciences & biomedicine","computer science","statistics & probability","biochemistry & molecular biology","science & technology","computer science, interdisciplinary applications","mathematics","biochemical research methods","technology"],"editors":[],"citations":[{"count":1,"source":"epmc"},{"count":0,"source":"scopus"}],"grants":[{"number":"DP150101550","awardedBy":"Australian Research Council"}],"funding_acknowledgements":"We appreciate the advice of the NCBI BLAST team on BLAST-related commands and parameters.

On the benchmark English Penn treebank, our model obtains strong UAS and LAS scores at 94.51% and 92.87%, respectively, producing 1.5+% absolute improvements to the BIST graph-based parser, and also obtaining a state-of-the-art POS tagging accuracy at 97.97%. Furthermore, experimental results on parsing 61 \"big\" Universal Dependencies treebanks from raw texts show that our model outperforms the baseline UDPipe (Straka and Strakova, 2017) with 0.8% higher average POS tagging score and 3.6% higher average LAS score. In addition, with our model, we also obtain state-of-the-art downstream task scores for biomedical event extraction and opinion analysis applications.

All rights reserved. In this paper we introduce the task of misflagged duplicate question detection for question pairs in community question-answer (cQA) archives and compare it to the more standard task of detecting valid duplicate questions. A misflagged duplicate is a question that has been erroneously hand-flagged by the community as a duplicate of an archived one, where the two questions are not actually the same. We find that for misflagged duplicate detection, meta data features that capture user authority, question quality, and relational data between questions, outperform pure text-based methods, while for regular duplicate detection a combination of meta data features and semantic features gives the best results. We show that misflagged duplicate questions are even more challenging to model than regular duplicate question detection, but that good results can still be obtained.","year":2018,"authors":[{"position":1,"first_name":"D","last_name":"Hoogeveen"},{"position":2,"first_name":"A","last_name":"Bennett"},{"position":3,"first_name":"Y","last_name":"Li"},{"position":4,"first_name":"KM","last_name":"Verspoor"},{"position":5,"first_name":"T","last_name":"Baldwin"}],"uom_authors":[{"person_id":28799,"preferred_name":"Tim Baldwin","first_name":"Tim","last_name":"Baldwin","org_id":4257,"org_name":"Computing and Information Systems"},{"person_id":458973,"preferred_name":"Karin Verspoor","first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor","org_id":4257,"org_name":"Computing and Information Systems"},{"person_id":829569,"preferred_name":"Yitong Li","first_name":"Yitong","last_name":"Li","org_id":4257,"org_name":"Computing and Information Systems"}],"is_public":true,"pagination":{"end":"120","begin":"112"},"keywords":[],"editors":[],"citations":[{"count":0,"source":"scopus"}],"grants":[],"subject_areas":[{"anzsrc_name":"FOR 2008 6 Digit Code","code":"080199","name_array":["Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing not elsewhere classified","Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing","Information and Computing Sciences"],"name_02":"Information and Computing Sciences","name_04":"Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing","name_06":"Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing not elsewhere classified"},{"anzsrc_name":"SEO 2008 6 Digit Code","code":"890205","name_array":["Information Processing Services (incl.

Specifically, we demonstrate that the published literature associated with each data record can be used to automatically evaluate its quality, by cross-checking the consistency of the key content of the database record with the referenced publications. Focusing on GenBank, we describe a set of quality indicators based on the relevance paradigm of information retrieval (IR). Then, we use these quality indicators to train an anomaly detection algorithm to classify records as “confident” or “suspicious” . Our experiments on the PubMed Central collection show assessing the coherence between the literature and database records, through our algorithms, is an effective mechanism for assisting curators to perform data cleansing. Although fewer than 0.25% of the records in our data set are known to be faulty, we would expect that there are many more in GenBank that have not yet been identified. By automated comparison with literature they can be identified with a precision of up to 10% and a recall of up to 30%, while strongly outperforming several baselines. While these results leave substantial room for improvement, they reflect both the very imbalanced nature of the data, and the limited explicitly labelled data that is available. Overall, the obtained results show promise for the development of a new kind of approach to detecting low-quality and suspicious sequence records based on literature analysis and consistency. From a practical point of view, this will greatly help curators in identifying inconsistent records in large-scale sequence databases by highlighting records that are likely to be inconsistent with the literature.","year":2017,"authors":[{"position":1,"first_name":"Mohamed Reda","last_name":"Bouadjenek"},{"position":2,"first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor"},{"position":3,"first_name":"Justin","last_name":"Zobel"}],"uom_authors":[{"person_id":764406,"preferred_name":"Mohamed Reda Bouadjenek","first_name":"Mohamed Reda","last_name":"Bouadjenek","org_id":4257,"org_name":"Computing and Information Systems"},{"person_id":87273,"preferred_name":"Justin Zobel","first_name":"Justin","last_name":"Zobel","org_id":5824,"org_name":"Research"},{"person_id":458973,"preferred_name":"Karin Verspoor","first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor","org_id":4257,"org_name":"Computing and Information Systems"}],"is_public":true,"doi":"10.1101/101246","keywords":[],"editors":[],"citations":[{"count":0,"source":"epmc"}],"grants":[]},{"id":"1179621","visibility":true,"last_updated":"2019-10-18T03:24:48.283000+00:00","publication_type":"Journal article","publisher_name":"OXFORD UNIV PRESS","journal_name":"Database","title":"Duplicates, redundancies and inconsistencies in the primary nucleotide databases: a descriptive study","year":2017,"authors":[{"position":1,"first_name":"Qingyu","last_name":"Chen"},{"position":2,"first_name":"Justin","last_name":"Zobel"},{"position":3,"first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor"}],"uom_authors":[{"person_id":458973,"preferred_name":"Karin Verspoor","first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor","org_id":4257,"org_name":"Computing and Information Systems"},{"person_id":87273,"preferred_name":"Justin Zobel","first_name":"Justin","last_name":"Zobel","org_id":5824,"org_name":"Research"}],"is_public":true,"doi":"10.1093/database/baw163","number":"ARTN baw163","pagination":{"end":"baw163","begin":"baw163"},"keywords":["science & technology","computational biology","sequence","errors","gc content","databases, nucleic acid","molecular sequence annotation","japan","mathematical & computational biology","life sciences & biomedicine"],"editors":[],"citations":[{"count":6,"source":"wos"},{"count":3,"source":"epmc"},{"count":10,"source":"scopus"}],"grants":[{"awardedBy":"University of Melbourne"},{"number":"DP150101550","awardedBy":"Australian Research Council"}],"funding_acknowledgements":"Qingyu Chen's work is supported by an International Research Scholarship from The University of Melbourne.

The presence of duplicates, implying either redundancy or inconsistency, can have a range of impacts on the quality of analyses that use the data. To provide a sound basis for research on this issue in databases of nucleotide sequences, we have developed new, large-scale validated collections of duplicates, which can be used to test the effectiveness of duplicate detection methods. Previous collections were either designed primarily to test efficiency, or contained only a limited number of duplicates of limited kinds. To date, duplicate detection methods have been evaluated on separate, inconsistent benchmarks, leading to results that cannot be compared and, due to limitations of the benchmarks, of questionable generality. In this study, we present three nucleotide sequence database benchmarks, based on information drawn from a range of resources, including information derived from mapping to two data sections within the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB), UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and UniProtKB/TrEMBL. Each benchmark has distinct characteristics. We quantify these characteristics and argue for their complementary value in evaluation. The benchmarks collectively contain a vast number of validated biological duplicates; the largest has nearly half a billion duplicate pairs (although this is probably only a tiny fraction of the total that is present). They are also the first benchmarks targeting the primary nucleotide databases. The records include the 21 most heavily studied organisms in molecular biology research. Our quantitative analysis shows that duplicates in the different benchmarks, and in different organisms, have different characteristics. It is thus unreliable to evaluate duplicate detection methods against any single benchmark. For example, the benchmark derived from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot mappings identifies more diverse types of duplicates, showing the importance of expert curation, but is limited to coding sequences. Overall, these benchmarks form a resource that we believe will be of great value for development and evaluation of the duplicate detection or record linkage methods that are required to help maintain these essential resources.

UniProt contain hundreds of millions of records of genomic data. These records are derived from direct submissions from individual laboratories, as well as from bulk submissions from large-scale sequencing centres; their diversity and scale means that they suffer from a range of data quality issues including errors, discrepancies, redundancies, ambiguities, incompleteness, and inconsistencies with the published literature. In this work, we seek to investigate and analyze the data quality of sequence databases from the perspective of a curator, who must detect anomalous and suspicious records. Specifically, we emphasize the detection of inconsistent records with respect to the literature. Focusing on GenBank, we propose a set of 24 quality indicators, which are based on treating a record as a query into the published literature, and then use query quality predictors. We then carry out an analysis that shows that the proposed quality indicators and the quality of the records have a mutual relationship, in which one depends on the other. We propose to represent record-literature consistency as a vector of these quality indicators. By reducing the dimensionality of this representation for visualization purposes using Principal Component Analysis, we show that records which have been reported as inconsistent with the literature fall roughly in the same area, and therefore share similar characteristics. By manually analyzing records not previously known to be erroneous that fall in the same area than records know to be inconsistent, we show that 1 record out of 4 is inconsistent with respect to the literature. This high density of inconsistent record opens the way towards the development of automatic methods for the detection of faulty records. We conclude that literature inconsistency is a meaningful strategy for identifying suspicious records.","year":2017,"authors":[{"position":1,"first_name":"Mohamed Reda","last_name":"Bouadjenek"},{"position":2,"first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor"},{"position":3,"first_name":"Justin","last_name":"Zobel"}],"uom_authors":[{"person_id":87273,"preferred_name":"Justin Zobel","first_name":"Justin","last_name":"Zobel","org_id":5824,"org_name":"Research"},{"person_id":764406,"preferred_name":"Mohamed Reda Bouadjenek","first_name":"Mohamed Reda","last_name":"Bouadjenek","org_id":4257,"org_name":"Computing and Information Systems"},{"person_id":458973,"preferred_name":"Karin Verspoor","first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor","org_id":4257,"org_name":"Computing and Information Systems"}],"is_public":true,"doi":"10.1101/101873","keywords":[],"editors":[],"citations":[{"count":0,"source":"epmc"}],"grants":[],"subject_areas":[{"anzsrc_name":"FOR 2008 6 Digit Code","code":"091599","name_array":["Interdisciplinary Engineering not elsewhere classified ","Interdisciplinary Engineering","Engineering"],"name_02":"Engineering","name_04":"Interdisciplinary Engineering","name_06":"Interdisciplinary Engineering not elsewhere classified "},{"anzsrc_name":"SEO 2008 6 Digit Code","code":"850499","name_array":["Energy Transformation not elsewhere classified","Energy Transformation","Energy","Economic Development"],"name_02":"Energy","name_04":"Energy Transformation","name_06":"Energy Transformation not elsewhere classified"}]},{"id":"1229533","visibility":true,"last_updated":"2019-10-05T05:21:00.420000+00:00","publication_type":"Journal article","publisher_name":"BIOMED CENTRAL LTD","journal_name":"BMC Bioinformatics","title":"Coreference annotation and resolution in the Colorado Richly Annotated Full Text (CRAFT) corpus of biomedical journal articles","year":2017,"authors":[{"position":1,"first_name":"K Bretonnel","last_name":"Cohen"},{"position":2,"first_name":"Arrick","last_name":"Lanfranchi"},{"position":3,"first_name":"Miji Joo-Young","last_name":"Choi"},{"position":4,"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Bada"},{"position":5,"first_name":"William A","last_name":"Baumgartner"},{"position":6,"first_name":"Natalya","last_name":"Panteleyeva"},{"position":7,"first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor"},{"position":8,"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"Palmer"},{"position":9,"first_name":"Lawrence E","last_name":"Hunter"}],"uom_authors":[{"person_id":458973,"preferred_name":"Karin Verspoor","first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor","org_id":4257,"org_name":"Computing and Information Systems"}],"is_public":true,"doi":"10.1186/s12859-017-1775-9","volume":"18","number":"ARTN 372","pagination":{"begin":"372"},"keywords":["science & technology","domain","periodicals as topic","semantics","benchmarking","resolution","adaptation","biotechnology & applied microbiology","information extraction","data mining","biochemical research methods","biochemistry & molecular biology","corpus","coreference","annotation","anaphora","mathematical & computational biology","life sciences & biomedicine"],"editors":[],"citations":[{"count":4,"source":"wos"},{"count":5,"source":"epmc"},{"count":4,"source":"scopus"}],"grants":[{"number":"G08 LM009639","awardedBy":"National Institutes of Health"},{"number":"3G08 LM009639-02S1","awardedBy":"National Institutes of Health"},{"number":"2R01LM009254","awardedBy":"National Institutes of Health"},{"number":"R01LM008111","awardedBy":"National Institutes of Health"},{"number":"DP150101550","awardedBy":"Australian Research Council"},{"awardedBy":"Australian Federal government"},{"awardedBy":"Victorian State government"},{"awardedBy":"Australian Research Council through the ICT Centre of Excellence program, National ICT Australia (NICTA)"},{"number":"BAA 14-14","awardedBy":"DARPA \"Big Mechanism\" program"},{"number":"W911NF-14-C-0109","awardedBy":"DARPA \"Big Mechanism\" program"}],"funding_acknowledgements":"The work here was supported by National Institutes of Health grants G08 LM009639, 3G08 LM009639-02S1 (ARRA), 2R01LM009254, and R01LM008111 to Lawrence E.

This paper describes the application and analysis of a previously developed textual emotion classification system (READ-BioMed-EC) on a different data set in the same language with different textual properties. The classifier makes use of a number of lexicon-based and text-based features. The data set originally used to develop this classifier consisted of English-language Twitter microblogs with mentions of Ebola disease. The data was manually labelled with one of six emotion classes, plus sarcasm, news-related, or neutral. In this new work, we applied the READ-BioMed-EC emotion classifier without retraining to an independently collected set of Web blog posts, also annotated with emotion classes, to understand how well the Twitter-trained disease-focused emotion classifier might generalise to an entirely different collection of open-domain sentences. The results of our study show that direct cross-genre application of the classifier does not achieve meaningful results, but when re-trained on the open-domain data set, the READ-BioMed-EC system outperforms the previously published results. The study has implications for cross-genre applicability of emotion classifiers, demonstrating that emotion is expressed differently in different text types.","year":2017,"authors":[{"position":1,"first_name":"B","last_name":"Ofoghi"},{"position":2,"first_name":"K","last_name":"Verspoor"}],"uom_authors":[{"person_id":458973,"preferred_name":"Karin Verspoor","first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor","org_id":4257,"org_name":"Computing and Information Systems"}],"is_public":true,"doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-63004-5_21","volume":"10400 LNAI","pagination":{"end":"273","begin":"262"},"keywords":[],"editors":[],"citations":[{"count":1,"source":"scopus"}],"grants":[],"subject_areas":[{"anzsrc_name":"FOR 2008 6 Digit Code","code":"080702","name_array":["Health Informatics","Library and Information Studies","Information and Computing Sciences"],"name_02":"Information and Computing Sciences","name_04":"Library and Information Studies","name_06":"Health Informatics"},{"anzsrc_name":"SEO 2008 6 Digit Code","code":"890399","name_array":["Information Services not elsewhere classified","Information Services","Information and Communication Services","Economic Development"],"name_02":"Information and Communication Services","name_04":"Information Services","name_06":"Information Services not elsewhere classified"}]},{"id":"1201431","visibility":true,"last_updated":"2019-04-09T04:10:15.017000+00:00","publication_type":"Journal article","publisher_name":"IOS PRESS","journal_name":"Studies in Health Technology and Informatics","title":"Developing a Manually Annotated Corpus of Clinical Letters for Breast Cancer Patients on Routine Follow-Up","year":2017,"authors":[{"position":1,"first_name":"Graham","last_name":"Pitson"},{"position":2,"first_name":"Patricia","last_name":"Banks"},{"position":3,"first_name":"Lawrence","last_name":"Cavedon"},{"position":4,"first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor"}],"uom_authors":[{"person_id":458973,"preferred_name":"Karin Verspoor","first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor","org_id":4257,"org_name":"Computing and Information Systems"}],"is_public":true,"doi":"10.3233/978-1-61499-753-5-196","volume":"235","pagination":{"end":"200","begin":"196"},"keywords":["breast neoplasms","receptors, estrogen","cancer follow-up","humans","annotated corpus","follow-up studies","science & technology","life sciences & biomedicine","public, environmental & occupational health","clinical letter corpus","health care sciences & services","female","natural language processing"],"editors":[{"position":1,"first_name":"R","last_name":"Randell"},{"position":2,"first_name":"R","last_name":"Cornet"},{"position":3,"first_name":"C","last_name":"McCowan"},{"position":4,"first_name":"N","last_name":"Peek"},{"position":5,"first_name":"PJ","last_name":"Scott"}],"citations":[{"count":0,"source":"epmc"},{"count":0,"source":"scopus"}],"grants":[],"subject_areas":[{"anzsrc_name":"FOR 2008 6 Digit Code","code":"080107","name_array":["Natural Language Processing","Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing","Information and Computing Sciences"],"name_02":"Information and Computing Sciences","name_04":"Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing","name_06":"Natural Language Processing"},{"anzsrc_name":"FOR 2008 6 Digit Code","code":"080702","name_array":["Health Informatics","Library and Information Studies","Information and Computing Sciences"],"name_02":"Information and Computing Sciences","name_04":"Library and Information Studies","name_06":"Health Informatics"},{"anzsrc_name":"SEO 2008 6 Digit Code","code":"890299","name_array":["Computer Software and Services not elsewhere classified","Computer Software and Services","Information and Communication Services","Economic Development"],"name_02":"Information and Communication Services","name_04":"Computer Software and Services","name_06":"Computer Software and Services not elsewhere classified"}]},{"id":"1226607","visibility":true,"last_updated":"2019-10-25T00:36:21.470000+00:00","publication_type":"Conference Proceedings","publisher_name":"IOS PRESS","journal_name":"Studies in Health Technology and Informatics","title":"Understanding Health Professionals' Informal Learning in Online Social Networks: A Cross-Sectional Survey","year":2017,"authors":[{"position":1,"first_name":"Xin","last_name":"Li"},{"position":2,"first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor"},{"position":3,"first_name":"Kathleen","last_name":"Gray"},{"position":4,"first_name":"Stephen","last_name":"Barnett"}],"uom_authors":[{"person_id":69154,"preferred_name":"Stephen Barnett","first_name":"Stephen","last_name":"Barnett","org_id":169,"org_name":"Surgery -

The presence of duplicates, implying either redundancy or inconsistency, can have a range of impacts on the quality of analyses that use the data. To provide a sound basis for research on this issue in databases of nucleotide sequences, we have developed new, large-scale validated collections of duplicates, which can be used to test the effectiveness of duplicate detection methods. Previous collections were either designed primarily to test efficiency, or contained only a limited number of duplicates of limited kinds. To date, duplicate detection methods have been evaluated on separate, inconsistent benchmarks, leading to results that cannot be compared and, due to limitations of the benchmarks, of questionable generality. In this study we present three nucleotide sequence database benchmarks, based on information drawn from a range of resources, including information derived from mapping to Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL. Each benchmark has distinct characteristics. We quantify these characteristics and argue for their complementary value in evaluation. The benchmarks collectively contain a vast number of validated biological duplicates; the largest has nearly half a billion duplicate pairs (although this is probably only a tiny fraction of the total that is present). They are also the first benchmarks targeting the primary nucleotide databases. The records include the 21 most heavily studied organisms in molecular biology research. Our quantitative analysis shows that duplicates in the different benchmarks, and in different organisms, have different characteristics. It is thus unreliable to evaluate duplicate detection methods against any single benchmark. For example, the benchmark derived from Swiss-Prot mappings identifies more diverse types of duplicates, showing the importance of expert curation, but is limited to coding sequences. Overall, these benchmarks form a resource that we believe will be of great value for development and evaluation of the duplicate detection methods that are required to help maintain these essential resources.

Chief complaints are readily available in digital formats and provide a good data source for syndromic surveillance. This paper reports our findings on the identification of the distribution of a few syndromes over time using the Victorian Syndromic Surveillance (SynSurv) data set. We utilized a machine learning-based Näive Bayes classifier to predict the syndromic group of unseen chief complaints. Then, we analyzed the patterns of the distributions of three syndromes in the Syn-Surv data, specifically the Flu-like Illness, Acute Respiratory, and Diarrhoea syndromes, over sliding windows of time using the EARS C1, C2, and C3 aberrancy detection algorithms. The results of our analyses demonstrate that applying aberrancy algorithms over the variance data between two consecutive weeks reduces the large number of possible disease outbreaks detected using raw frequencies of the syndromic groups in the same time period, resulting in a more feasible approach for practical syndromic surveillance.","year":2016,"authors":[{"position":1,"first_name":"H","last_name":"Aamer"},{"position":2,"first_name":"B","last_name":"Ofoghi"},{"position":3,"first_name":"K","last_name":"Verspoor"}],"uom_authors":[{"person_id":458973,"preferred_name":"Karin Verspoor","first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor","org_id":4257,"org_name":"Computing and Information Systems"}],"is_public":true,"volume":"1683","keywords":[],"editors":[],"citations":[{"count":0,"source":"scopus"}],"grants":[],"subject_areas":[{"anzsrc_name":"FOR 2008 6 Digit Code","code":"080107","name_array":["Natural Language Processing","Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing","Information and Computing Sciences"],"name_02":"Information and Computing Sciences","name_04":"Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing","name_06":"Natural Language Processing"},{"anzsrc_name":"SEO 2008 6 Digit Code","code":"890205","name_array":["Information Processing Services (incl.

One of the issues causing this is the lack of tools for exploring information and assisting in navigation within health websites. As a result, relevant information cannot be easily discovered. We hope to rectify this issue from the design perspective. Based on previous work, we have created a prototype website called Better Health Explorer to better support such information seeking behaviours. This paper reports on a quantitative study evaluating this prototype. The results demonstrate several improvements in health information seeking supported by the tool. Furthermore, we have identified three general design characteristics that should to be considered when designing consumer health websites. These findings have design implications for health information seeking applications, as well as identifying directions for further research.","year":2016,"authors":[{"position":1,"first_name":"PCI","last_name":"Pang"},{"position":2,"first_name":"S","last_name":"Chang"},{"position":3,"first_name":"K","last_name":"Verspoor"},{"position":4,"first_name":"J","last_name":"Pearce"}],"uom_authors":[{"person_id":611522,"preferred_name":"Patrick Pang","first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"Pang","org_id":4257,"org_name":"Computing and Information Systems"},{"person_id":458973,"preferred_name":"Karin Verspoor","first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor","org_id":4257,"org_name":"Computing and Information Systems"},{"person_id":3747,"preferred_name":"Shanton Chang","first_name":"Shanton","last_name":"Chang","org_id":4257,"org_name":"Computing and Information Systems"}],"is_public":true,"keywords":[],"editors":[],"citations":[{"count":0,"source":"scopus"}],"grants":[],"subject_areas":[{"anzsrc_name":"FOR 2008 6 Digit Code","code":"080702","name_array":["Health Informatics","Library and Information Studies","Information and Computing Sciences"],"name_02":"Information and Computing Sciences","name_04":"Library and Information Studies","name_06":"Health Informatics"},{"anzsrc_name":"SEO 2008 6 Digit Code","code":"890399","name_array":["Information Services not elsewhere classified","Information Services","Information and Communication Services","Economic Development"],"name_02":"Information and Communication Services","name_04":"Information Services","name_06":"Information Services not elsewhere classified"}]},{"id":"1110065","visibility":true,"last_updated":"2019-05-24T03:35:05.650000+00:00","publication_type":"Conference Proceedings","publisher_name":"Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics","journal_name":"16th SIAM International Conference on Data Mining 2016, SDM 2016","title":"A framework to adjust dependency measure estimates for chance","abstract":"Copyright © by SIAM. Estimating the strength of dependency between two variables is fundamental for exploratory analysis and many other applications in data mining. For example: non-linear dependencies between two continuous variables can be explored with the Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC); and categorical variables that are dependent to the target class are selected using Gini gain in random forests. Nonetheless, because dependency measures are estimated on finite samples, the in-terpretability of their quantification and the accuracy when ranking dependencies become challenging. Dependency estimates are not equal to 0 when variables are independent, cannot be compared if computed on different sample size, and they are inflated by chance on variables with more categories. In this paper, we propose a framework to adjust dependency measure estimates on finite samples. Our adjustments, which are simple and applicable to any dependency measure, are helpful in improving interpretability when quantifying dependency and in improving accuracy on the task of ranking dependencies. In particular, we demonstrate that our approach enhances the interpretability of MIC when used as a proxy for the amount of noise between variables, and to gain accuracy when ranking variables during the splitting procedure in random forests.","year":2016,"authors":[{"position":1,"first_name":"S","last_name":"Romano"},{"position":2,"first_name":"XV","last_name":"Nguyen"},{"position":3,"first_name":"J","last_name":"Bailey"},{"position":4,"first_name":"K","last_name":"Verspoor"}],"uom_authors":[{"person_id":351,"preferred_name":"James Bailey","first_name":"James","last_name":"Bailey","org_id":4257,"org_name":"Computing and Information Systems"},{"person_id":458973,"preferred_name":"Karin Verspoor","first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor","org_id":4257,"org_name":"Computing and Information Systems"},{"person_id":618008,"preferred_name":"Xuan Nguyen","first_name":"Xuan","last_name":"Nguyen","org_id":4257,"org_name":"Computing and Information Systems"}],"is_public":true,"pagination":{"end":"431","begin":"423"},"keywords":[],"editors":[],"citations":[{"count":4,"source":"scopus"}],"grants":[],"subject_areas":[{"anzsrc_name":"FOR 2008 6 Digit Code","code":"080109","name_array":["Pattern Recognition and Data Mining","Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing","Information and Computing Sciences"],"name_02":"Information and Computing Sciences","name_04":"Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing","name_06":"Pattern Recognition and Data Mining"},{"anzsrc_name":"SEO 2008 6 Digit Code","code":"890205","name_array":["Information Processing Services (incl.

Their records are derived from laboratory work undertaken by different individuals, by different teams, with a range of technologies and assumptions, and over a period of decades. As a consequence, they contain a great many duplicates, redundancies, and inconsistencies, but neither the prevalence nor the characteristics of various types of duplicates have been rigorously assessed. Existing duplicate detection methods in bioinformatics only address specific duplicate types, with inconsistent assumptions; and the impact of duplicates in bioinformatics databases has not been carefully assessed, making it difficult to judge the value of such methods. Our goal is to assess the scale, kinds, and impact of duplicates in bioinformatics databases, through a retrospective analysis of merged groups in INSDC databases. Our outcomes are threefold: (1) We analyse a benchmark dataset consisting of duplicates manually identified in INSDC – a dataset of 67,888 merged groups with 111,823 duplicate pairs across 21 organisms from INSDC databases – in terms of the prevalence, types, and impacts of duplicates. (2) We categorise duplicates at both sequence and annotation level, with supporting quantitative statistics, showing that different organisms have different prevalence of distinct kinds of duplicate. (3) We show that the presence of duplicates has practical impact via a simple case study on duplicates, in terms of GC content and melting temperature. We demonstrate that duplicates not only introduce redundancy, but can lead to inconsistent results for certain tasks. Our findings lead to a better understanding of the problem of duplication in biological databases.","year":2016,"authors":[{"position":1,"first_name":"Qingyu","last_name":"Chen"},{"position":2,"first_name":"Justin","last_name":"Zobel"},{"position":3,"first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor"}],"uom_authors":[{"person_id":87273,"preferred_name":"Justin Zobel","first_name":"Justin","last_name":"Zobel","org_id":5824,"org_name":"Research"},{"person_id":458973,"preferred_name":"Karin Verspoor","first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor","org_id":4257,"org_name":"Computing and Information Systems"}],"is_public":true,"doi":"10.1101/085019","keywords":[],"editors":[],"citations":[{"count":0,"source":"epmc"}],"grants":[]},{"id":"1110064","visibility":true,"last_updated":"2019-05-24T16:44:01.337000+00:00","publication_type":"Journal article","publisher_name":"PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","journal_name":"PLOS ONE","title":"The Pre-Eclampsia Ontology: A Disease Ontology Representing the Domain Knowledge Specific to Pre-Eclampsia","year":2016,"authors":[{"position":1,"first_name":"Satoshi","last_name":"Mizuno"},{"position":2,"first_name":"Soichi","last_name":"Ogishima"},{"position":3,"first_name":"Hidekazu","last_name":"Nishigori"},{"position":4,"first_name":"Daniel G","last_name":"Jamieson"},{"position":5,"first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor"},{"position":6,"first_name":"Hiroshi","last_name":"Tanaka"},{"position":7,"first_name":"Nobuo","last_name":"Yaegashi"},{"position":8,"first_name":"Jun","last_name":"Nakaya"}],"uom_authors":[{"person_id":458973,"preferred_name":"Karin Verspoor","first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor","org_id":4257,"org_name":"Computing and Information Systems"}],"is_public":true,"resource_link":"http://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/bitstream/11343/122857/1/Mizuno.PDF","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0162828","issue":"10","volume":"11","number":"ARTN e0162828","pagination":{"begin":"e0162828"},"keywords":["hypertension","terminology as topic","biological ontologies","variants","multidisciplinary sciences","science & technology - other topics","humans","pre-eclampsia","pregnancy","science & technology","phenotype ontology","pathophysiology","women","risk","female","biology"],"editors":[],"citations":[{"count":1,"source":"wos"},{"count":2,"source":"epmc"},{"count":1,"source":"scopus"}],"grants":[{"awardedBy":"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan"}],"funding_acknowledgements":"This work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan.We are grateful for the helpful comments from the editor and anonymous referees.

At present, only a small fraction of human protein coding genes have HPO annotations. But, researchers believe that a large portion of currently unannotated genes are related to disease phenotypes. Therefore, it is important to predict gene-HPO term associations using accurate computational methods. In this work we demonstrate the performance advantage of the structured SVM approach which was shown to be highly effective for Gene Ontology term prediction in comparison to several baseline methods. Furthermore, we highlight a collection of informative data sources suitable for the problem of predicting gene-HPO associations, including large scale literature mining data.

They can also be used more generally to monitor disease trends and provide reassurance that an outbreak has not occurred. One commonly used technique for syndromic surveillance is concerned with classifying Emergency Department data, such as chief complaints or triage notes, into a set of pre-defined syndromic groups. This paper reports our findings on the investigation of the utility and effectiveness of two existing North American methods for free-text chief complaint classification on a large data set of Australian Emergency Department triage notes, collected from two hospitals in the state of Victoria. To our knowledge, these methods have never before been analysed and compared against each other for their applicability and effectiveness on free text chief complaint classification at this scale or in the Australian context.","year":2015,"authors":[{"position":1,"first_name":"B","last_name":"Ofoghi"},{"position":2,"first_name":"K","last_name":"Verspoor"}],"uom_authors":[{"person_id":458973,"preferred_name":"Karin Verspoor","first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor","org_id":4257,"org_name":"Computing and Information Systems"}],"is_public":true,"volume":"1468","keywords":[],"editors":[{"position":1,"first_name":"K","last_name":"Barbuto"},{"position":2,"first_name":"L","last_name":"Schaper"},{"position":3,"first_name":"K","last_name":"Verspoor"}],"citations":[{"count":0,"source":"scopus"}],"grants":[],"subject_areas":[{"anzsrc_name":"FOR 2008 6 Digit Code","code":"080702","name_array":["Health Informatics","Library and Information Studies","Information and Computing Sciences"],"name_02":"Information and Computing Sciences","name_04":"Library and Information Studies","name_06":"Health Informatics"},{"anzsrc_name":"SEO 2008 6 Digit Code","code":"890299","name_array":["Computer Software and Services not elsewhere classified","Computer Software and Services","Information and Communication Services","Economic Development"],"name_02":"Information and Communication Services","name_04":"Computer Software and Services","name_06":"Computer Software and Services not elsewhere classified"}]},{"id":"950687","visibility":true,"last_updated":"2019-10-25T05:21:14.970000+00:00","publication_type":"Journal article","publisher_name":"BioMed Central","journal_name":"Journal of Biomedical Semantics","title":"Evaluating a variety of text-mined features for automatic protein function prediction","year":2015,"authors":[{"position":1,"first_name":"C","last_name":"Funk"},{"position":2,"first_name":"I","last_name":"Kahanda"},{"position":3,"first_name":"A","last_name":"Ben-Hur"},{"position":4,"first_name":"CM","last_name":"VERSPOOR"}],"uom_authors":[{"person_id":458973,"preferred_name":"Karin Verspoor","first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor","org_id":4257,"org_name":"Computing and Information Systems"}],"is_public":true,"doi":"10.1186/s13326-015-0006-4","issue":"9","volume":"6","pagination":{"begin":"9"},"keywords":["protein function prediction","life sciences & biomedicine","mathematical & computational biology","text mining","science & technology","biomedical concept recognition"],"editors":[{"position":1,"first_name":"N","last_name":"Shah"},{"position":2,"first_name":"M","last_name":"Dumontier"},{"position":3,"first_name":"L","last_name":"Soldatova"},{"position":4,"first_name":"P","last_name":"Rocca-Serra"}],"citations":[{"count":13,"source":"wos"},{"count":8,"source":"epmc"},{"count":16,"source":"scopus"}],"grants":[{"number":"2T15LM009451","awardedBy":"NIH"},{"number":"DBI-0965616","awardedBy":"NSF"},{"number":"DBI-0965768","awardedBy":"NSF"},{"awardedBy":"NICTA - Australian Government"},{"awardedBy":"Australian Research Council through the ICT Centre of Excellence program"}],"funding_acknowledgements":"This work was funded by NIH grant 2T15LM009451 and NSF grants DBI-0965616 and DBI-0965768 to ABH.

The automatic extraction of chemical information from text requires the recognition of chemical entity mentions as one of its key steps. When developing supervised named entity recognition (NER) systems, the availability of a large, manually annotated text corpus is desirable. Furthermore, large corpora permit the robust evaluation and comparison of different approaches that detect chemicals in documents. We present the CHEMDNER corpus, a collection of 10,000 PubMed abstracts that contain a total of 84,355 chemical entity mentions labeled manually by expert chemistry literature curators, following annotation guidelines specifically defined for this task. The abstracts of the CHEMDNER corpus were selected to be representative for all major chemical disciplines. Each of the chemical entity mentions was manually labeled according to its structure-associated chemical entity mention (SACEM) class: abbreviation, family, formula, identifier, multiple, systematic and trivial. The difficulty and consistency of tagging chemicals in text was measured using an agreement study between annotators, obtaining a percentage agreement of 91. For a subset of the CHEMDNER corpus (the test set of 3,000 abstracts) we provide not only the Gold Standard manual annotations, but also mentions automatically detected by the 26 teams that participated in the BioCreative IV CHEMDNER chemical mention recognition task. In addition, we release the CHEMDNER silver standard corpus of automatically extracted mentions from 17,000 randomly selected PubMed abstracts. A version of the CHEMDNER corpus in the BioC format has been generated as well. We propose a standard for required minimum information about entity annotations for the construction of domain specific corpora on chemical and drug entities. The CHEMDNER corpus and annotation guidelines are available at: http://www.biocreative.org/resources/biocreative-iv/chemdner-corpus/.","year":2015,"authors":[{"position":1,"first_name":"M","last_name":"Krallinger"},{"position":2,"first_name":"O","last_name":"Rabal"},{"position":3,"first_name":"F","last_name":"Leitner"},{"position":4,"first_name":"M","last_name":"Vazquez"},{"position":5,"first_name":"D","last_name":"Salgado"},{"position":6,"first_name":"Z","last_name":"Lu"},{"position":7,"first_name":"R","last_name":"Leaman"},{"position":8,"first_name":"Y","last_name":"Lu"},{"position":9,"first_name":"D","last_name":"Ji"},{"position":10,"first_name":"DM","last_name":"Lowe"},{"position":11,"first_name":"RA","last_name":"Sayle"},{"position":12,"first_name":"RT","last_name":"Batista-Navarro"},{"position":13,"first_name":"R","last_name":"Rak"},{"position":14,"first_name":"T","last_name":"Huber"},{"position":15,"first_name":"T","last_name":"Rocktäschel"},{"position":16,"first_name":"S","last_name":"Matos"},{"position":17,"first_name":"D","last_name":"Campos"},{"position":18,"first_name":"B","last_name":"Tang"},{"position":19,"first_name":"H","last_name":"Xu"},{"position":20,"first_name":"T","last_name":"Munkhdalai"},{"position":21,"first_name":"KH","last_name":"Ryu"},{"position":22,"first_name":"SV","last_name":"Ramanan"},{"position":23,"first_name":"S","last_name":"Nathan"},{"position":24,"first_name":"S","last_name":"Žitnik"},{"position":25,"first_name":"M","last_name":"Bajec"},{"position":26,"first_name":"L","last_name":"Weber"},{"position":27,"first_name":"M","last_name":"Irmer"},{"position":28,"first_name":"SA","last_name":"Akhondi"},{"position":29,"first_name":"JA","last_name":"Kors"},{"position":30,"first_name":"S","last_name":"Xu"},{"position":31,"first_name":"X","last_name":"An"},{"position":32,"first_name":"UK","last_name":"Sikdar"},{"position":33,"first_name":"A","last_name":"Ekbal"},{"position":34,"first_name":"M","last_name":"Yoshioka"},{"position":35,"first_name":"TM","last_name":"Dieb"},{"position":36,"first_name":"M","last_name":"Choi"},{"position":37,"first_name":"K","last_name":"Verspoor"},{"position":38,"first_name":"M","last_name":"Khabsa"},{"position":39,"first_name":"CL","last_name":"Giles"},{"position":40,"first_name":"H","last_name":"Liu"},{"position":41,"first_name":"KE","last_name":"Ravikumar"},{"position":42,"first_name":"A","last_name":"Lamurias"},{"position":43,"first_name":"FM","last_name":"Couto"},{"position":44,"first_name":"HJ","last_name":"Dai"},{"position":45,"first_name":"RTH","last_name":"Tsai"},{"position":46,"first_name":"C","last_name":"Ata"},{"position":47,"first_name":"T","last_name":"Can"},{"position":48,"first_name":"A","last_name":"Usié"},{"position":49,"first_name":"R","last_name":"Alves"},{"position":50,"first_name":"I","last_name":"Segura-Bedmar"},{"position":51,"first_name":"P","last_name":"Martínez"},{"position":52,"first_name":"J","last_name":"Oyarzabal"},{"position":53,"first_name":"A","last_name":"Valencia"}],"uom_authors":[{"person_id":458973,"preferred_name":"Karin Verspoor","first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor","org_id":4257,"org_name":"Computing and Information Systems"}],"is_public":true,"resource_link":"http://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/bitstream/11343/52658/1/The+CHEMDNER+corpus+of+chemicals+and+drugs+and+its+annotation+principles..pdf","doi":"10.1186/1758-2946-7-S1-S2","issue":"Supplement 1","volume":"7","number":"S2","pagination":{"end":"17","begin":"1"},"keywords":["text","machine learning","chemnlp","chemistry, multidisciplinary","computer science, information systems","biocreative","chemical entity recognition","chemical indexing","physical sciences","named entity recognition","text mining","science & technology","chemistry","computer science, interdisciplinary applications","extraction","computer science","technology"],"editors":[],"citations":[{"count":53,"source":"wos"},{"count":19,"source":"epmc"},{"count":51,"source":"scopus"}],"grants":[{"awardedBy":"Innovative Medicines Initiative Joint Undertaking (IMI-eTOX)"},{"number":"222886-2","awardedBy":"MICROME grant"}],"funding_acknowledgements":"This work is supported by the Innovative Medicines Initiative Joint Undertaking (IMI-eTOX) and the MICROME grant 222886-2.

METHODS: Survey of trends in this work, and exploration of literature describing how large-scale structured and unstructured data sources are being used to support applications from clinical decision making and health policy, to drug design and pharmacovigilance, and further to systems biology and genetics. RESULTS: The survey highlights ongoing development of powerful new methods for turning that large-scale, and often complex, data into information that provides new insights into human health, in a range of different areas. Consideration of this body of work identifies several important paradigm shifts that are facilitated by Big Data resources and methods: in clinical and translational research, from hypothesis-driven research to data-driven research, and in medicine, from evidence-based practice to practice-based evidence. CONCLUSIONS: The increasing scale and availability of large quantities of health data require strategies for data management, data linkage, and data integration beyond the limits of many existing information systems, and substantial effort is underway to meet those needs. As our ability to make sense of that data improves, the value of the data will continue to increase. Health systems, genetics and genomics, population and public health; all areas of biomedicine stand to benefit from Big Data and the associated technologies.","year":2014,"authors":[{"position":1,"first_name":"F","last_name":"Martin-Sanchez"},{"position":2,"first_name":"K","last_name":"Verspoor"}],"uom_authors":[{"person_id":424225,"preferred_name":"Fernando Martin Sanchez","first_name":"Fernando","last_name":"Martin Sanchez","org_id":147,"org_name":"Melbourne Medical School"},{"person_id":458973,"preferred_name":"Karin Verspoor","first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor","org_id":4257,"org_name":"Computing and Information Systems"}],"is_public":true,"doi":"10.15265/IY-2014-0020","volume":"9","pagination":{"end":"20","begin":"14"},"keywords":["information systems","text mining","computational biology","humans","data mining","biomedical research","information storage and retrieval","databases, factual","social media","medical informatics"],"editors":[],"citations":[{"count":17,"source":"epmc"},{"count":43,"source":"scopus"}],"grants":[],"subject_areas":[{"anzsrc_name":"FOR 2008 6 Digit Code","code":"080109","name_array":["Pattern Recognition and Data Mining","Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing","Information and Computing Sciences"],"name_02":"Information and Computing Sciences","name_04":"Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing","name_06":"Pattern Recognition and Data Mining"},{"anzsrc_name":"FOR 2008 6 Digit Code","code":"080301","name_array":["Bioinformatics Software","Computer Software","Information and Computing Sciences"],"name_02":"Information and Computing Sciences","name_04":"Computer Software","name_06":"Bioinformatics Software"},{"anzsrc_name":"SEO 2008 6 Digit Code","code":"890299","name_array":["Computer Software and Services not elsewhere classified","Computer Software and Services","Information and Communication Services","Economic Development"],"name_02":"Information and Communication Services","name_04":"Computer Software and Services","name_06":"Computer Software and Services not elsewhere classified"}]},{"id":"950372","visibility":true,"last_updated":"2019-10-25T15:31:32.790000+00:00","publication_type":"Conference Proceedings","publisher_name":"ACL","journal_name":"Proceedings of the 2014 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP)","title":"What Can We Get From 1000 Tokens?

Much of the source information relevant to such efforts is available only from unstructured sources such as the scientific literature, and significant resources are expended in manually curating and structuring the information in the literature. As such, there have been a number of systems developed to target automatic extraction of mutations and other genetic variation from the literature using text mining tools. We have performed a broad survey of the existing publicly available tools for extraction of genetic variants from the scientific literature. We consider not just one tool but a number of different tools, individually and in combination, and apply the tools in two scenarios. First, they are compared in an intrinsic evaluation context, where the tools are tested for their ability to identify specific mentions of genetic variants in a corpus of manually annotated papers, the Variome corpus. Second, they are compared in an extrinsic evaluation context based on our previous study of text mining support for curation of the COSMIC and InSiGHT databases. Our results demonstrate that no single tool covers the full range of genetic variants mentioned in the literature. Rather, several tools have complementary coverage and can be used together effectively. In the intrinsic evaluation on the Variome corpus, the combined performance is above 0.95 in F-measure, while in the extrinsic evaluation the combined recall performance is above 0.71 for COSMIC and above 0.62 for InSiGHT, a substantial improvement over the performance of any individual tool. Based on the analysis of these results, we suggest several directions for the improvement of text mining tools for genetic variant extraction from the literature.

The NCBI Entrez online web-search interface is convenient for simple manual search for a small number of genes but impractical for the kinds of outputs seen in typical genomics projects.ResultsWe have developed an efficient open source tool implemented in Python called Annokey, which annotates gene lists with the results of a keyword search of the NCBI Entrez Gene database and linked Pubmed article information. The user steers the search by specifying a ranked list of keywords (including multi-word phrases and regular expressions) that are correlated with their topic of interest. Rank information of matched terms allows the user to guide further investigation.We applied Annokey to the entire human Entrez Gene database using the key-term “DNA repair” and assessed its performance in identifying the 176 members of a published “gold standard” list of genes established to be involved in this pathway. For this test case we observed a sensitivity and specificity of 97% and 96%, respectively.ConclusionsAnnokey facilitates the identification of genes related to an area of interest, a task which can be onerous if performed manually on a large number of genes. Annokey provides a way to capitalize on the high quality information provided by the Entrez Gene database allowing both scalability and compatibility with automated analysis pipelines, thus offering the potential to significantly enhance research productivity.","year":2014,"authors":[{"position":1,"first_name":"Daniel J","last_name":"Park"},{"position":2,"first_name":"Tú","last_name":"Nguyen-Dumont"},{"position":3,"first_name":"Sori","last_name":"Kang"},{"position":4,"first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor"},{"position":5,"first_name":"Bernard J","last_name":"Pope"}],"uom_authors":[{"person_id":458973,"preferred_name":"Karin Verspoor","first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor","org_id":4257,"org_name":"Computing and Information Systems"},{"person_id":8653,"preferred_name":"Daniel Park","first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"Park","org_id":140,"org_name":"Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences"},{"person_id":415840,"preferred_name":"Tu Nguyen","first_name":"Tu","last_name":"Nguyen","org_id":6539,"org_name":"Clinical Pathology"},{"person_id":1827,"preferred_name":"Bernie Pope","first_name":"Bernie","last_name":"Pope","org_id":140,"org_name":"Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences"}],"is_public":true,"doi":"10.1186/1751-0473-9-15","volume":"9","medium":"Undetermined","pagination":{"end":"15","begin":"15"},"keywords":[],"editors":[],"citations":[{"count":1,"source":"epmc"},{"count":3,"source":"scopus"}],"grants":[],"subject_areas":[{"anzsrc_name":"FOR 2008 6 Digit Code","code":"080301","name_array":["Bioinformatics Software","Computer Software","Information and Computing Sciences"],"name_02":"Information and Computing Sciences","name_04":"Computer Software","name_06":"Bioinformatics Software"},{"anzsrc_name":"SEO 2008 6 Digit Code","code":"890299","name_array":["Computer Software and Services not elsewhere classified","Computer Software and Services","Information and Communication Services","Economic Development"],"name_02":"Information and Communication Services","name_04":"Computer Software and Services","name_06":"Computer Software and Services not elsewhere classified"}]},{"id":"974882","visibility":true,"last_updated":"2019-03-16T20:27:42.383000+00:00","publication_type":"Abstract","journal_name":"CEUR Workshop Proceedings","title":"Enhancing diagnostics for invasive Aspergillosis using machine learning","year":2014,"authors":[{"position":1,"first_name":"S","last_name":"Romano"},{"position":2,"first_name":"J","last_name":"Bailey"},{"position":3,"first_name":"L","last_name":"Cavedon"},{"position":4,"first_name":"O","last_name":"Morrissey"},{"position":5,"first_name":"M","last_name":"Slavin"},{"position":6,"first_name":"K","last_name":"Verspoor"}],"uom_authors":[{"person_id":458973,"preferred_name":"Karin Verspoor","first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor","org_id":4257,"org_name":"Computing and Information Systems"},{"person_id":351,"preferred_name":"James Bailey","first_name":"James","last_name":"Bailey","org_id":4257,"org_name":"Computing and Information Systems"},{"person_id":280,"preferred_name":"Monica Slavin","first_name":"Monica","last_name":"Slavin","org_id":173,"org_name":"Medicine -

The method searches text for mentions of amino acids at specific sequence positions and attempts to correctly associate each mention with a protein also named in the text. The methods presented in this work will enable improved protein functional site extraction from articles, ultimately supporting protein function prediction. Our method made use of linguistic patterns for identifying the amino acid residue mentions in text. Further, we applied an automated graph-based method to learn syntactic patterns corresponding to protein-residue pairs mentioned in the text. We finally present an approach to automated construction of relevant training and test data using the distant supervision model. RESULTS: The performance of the method was assessed by extracting protein-residue relations from a new automatically generated test set of sentences containing high confidence examples found using distant supervision. It achieved a F-measure of 0.84 on automatically created silver corpus and 0.79 on a manually annotated gold data set for this task, outperforming previous methods. CONCLUSIONS: The primary contributions of this work are to (1) demonstrate the effectiveness of distant supervision for automatic creation of training data for protein-residue relation extraction, substantially reducing the effort and time involved in manual annotation of a data set and (2) show that the graph-based relation extraction approach we used generalizes well to the problem of protein-residue association extraction. This work paves the way towards effective extraction of protein functional residues from the literature.","year":2012,"authors":[{"position":1,"first_name":"Ke","last_name":"Ravikumar"},{"position":2,"first_name":"Haibin","last_name":"Liu"},{"position":3,"first_name":"Judith D","last_name":"Cohn"},{"position":4,"first_name":"Michael E","last_name":"Wall"},{"position":5,"first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor"}],"uom_authors":[{"person_id":458973,"preferred_name":"Karin Verspoor","first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor","org_id":4257,"org_name":"Computing and Information Systems"}],"is_public":true,"doi":"10.1186/2041-1480-3-S3-S2","volume":"3 Suppl 3","pagination":{"begin":"S2"},"keywords":[],"editors":[],"citations":[{"count":10,"source":"epmc"},{"count":24,"source":"scopus"}],"grants":[],"subject_areas":[{"anzsrc_name":"FOR 2008 6 Digit Code","code":"080199","name_array":["Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing not elsewhere classified","Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing","Information and Computing Sciences"],"name_02":"Information and Computing Sciences","name_04":"Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing","name_06":"Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing not elsewhere classified"},{"anzsrc_name":"SEO 2008 6 Digit Code","code":"890205","name_array":["Information Processing Services (incl.

Biocomputing 2006, PSB 2006","title":"Large-scale testing of bibliome informatics using Pfam protein families.","abstract":"Literature mining is expected to help not only with automatically sifting through huge biomedical literature and annotation databases, but also with linking bio-chemical entities to appropriate functional hypotheses. However, there has been very limited success in testing literature mining methods due to the lack of large, objectively validated test sets or \"gold standards\". To improve this situation we created a large-scale test of literature mining methods and resources. We report on a specific implementation of this test: how well can the Pfam protein family classification be replicated from independently mining different literature/annotation resources? We test and compare different keyterm sets as well as different algorithms for issuing protein family predictions. We find that protein families can indeed be automatically predicted from the literature. Using words from PubMed abstracts, of 3663 proteins tested, over 75% were correctly assigned to one of 618 Pfam families. For 90% of proteins the correct Pfam family was among the top 5 ranked families. We found that protein family prediction is far superior with keywords extracted from PubMed abstracts than with GO annotations or MeSH keyterms, suggesting that the text itself (in combination with the vector space model) is superior to GO and MeSH as a literature mining resources, at least for detecting protein family membership. Finally, we show that Shannon's entropy can be exploited to improve prediction by facilitating the integration of the different literature sources tested.","year":2006,"authors":[{"position":1,"first_name":"Ana G","last_name":"Maguitman"},{"position":2,"first_name":"Andreas","last_name":"Rechtsteiner"},{"position":3,"first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor"},{"position":4,"first_name":"Charlie E","last_name":"Strauss"},{"position":5,"first_name":"Luis M","last_name":"Rocha"}],"uom_authors":[{"person_id":458973,"preferred_name":"Karin Verspoor","first_name":"Karin","last_name":"Verspoor","org_id":4257,"org_name":"Computing and Information Systems"}],"is_public":true,"pagination":{"end":"87","begin":"76"},"keywords":["algorithms","databases, protein","computational biology"],"editors":[],"citations":[{"count":1,"source":"epmc"},{"count":4,"source":"scopus"}],"grants":[],"subject_areas":[{"anzsrc_name":"FOR 2008 6 Digit Code","code":"060102","name_array":["Bioinformatics","Biochemistry and Cell Biology","Biological Sciences"],"name_02":"Biological Sciences","name_04":"Biochemistry and Cell Biology","name_06":"Bioinformatics"},{"anzsrc_name":"SEO 2008 6 Digit Code","code":"890399","name_array":["Information Services not elsewhere classified","Information Services","Information and Communication Services","Economic Development"],"name_02":"Information and Communication Services","name_04":"Information Services","name_06":"Information Services not elsewhere classified"}]},{"id":"1346308","visibility":true,"last_updated":"2019-07-05T18:27:50.390000+00:00","publication_type":"Conference Proceedings","journal_name":"HLT-NAACL 2006 -
